# UK Solar System Planetary Atmospheres

The study of Planetary Atmospheres is a key component of the UK’s planetary science portfolio, enabling global leadership in instrumentation, multi-spectral data analysis (both space- and ground-based), and numerical simulation.  In recent decades, this has provided unique results from astronomical observatories and visiting spacecraft (e.g., Venus Express, Mars Express, ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, Galileo, Cassini, and Juno).

## Previous Community Meetings

* UK Planetary Atmospheres Meeting 2020, [February 2020](https://doi.org/10.1093/astrogeo/ataa040), the full schedule for the meeting can be found [here](meeting2020.md).
* Weather on other planets: measurement and interpretation, [2015](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wea.2761)
* Weather and climate on the planets, [2008](https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wea.273) 

The community last met at a RAS-sponsored meeting in [February 2020](https://doi.org/10.1093/astrogeo/ataa040), providing an opportunity to celebrate achievements, to network and discuss future opportunities, and to give early-career researchers a chance to present their latest discoveries.  By establishing a formal community, focussed on a regular meeting, we aimed to improve the organisation and visibility of this key research area in the UK.  With COVID restrictions behind us, we hope to build on this foundation, and have secured the endorsements of both the Royal Meteorological Society (RMetS) and Europlanet Ireland-UK Hub to host a second community meeting.  Invited presentations at our first meeting celebrated our history, in particular the late Prof. Fred Taylor looked back at planetary atmospheric science throughout the late 20th century.  Our second meeting will help us to develop stronger connections to related fields:  we propose to invite experts in stratospheric circulation/chemistry of Earth’s atmosphere, as well as experts on the interconnection between atmospheres and the magnetosphere/ionosphere.  Such a gathering permits information/technique exchange, timely research updates, as well as fostering future collaborations in this growing field.  

## UK Planetary Atmospheres Community

The UK community is spread across a number of universities (Bristol, Exeter, Leicester, Leeds, Newcastle, Open University, Oxford, UCL, Lancaster, Imperial), but unlike other UK communities (e.g., MIST, UK-Solar-Physics, Exoplanets) there are no regular community meetings.   A UK community meeting is timely given (i) upcoming atmospheric research opportunities from JWST in 2022/23; (ii) the forthcoming launch of ESA/JUICE in 2023; (iii) capitalising on data being provided by missions including ExoMars/TGO and Juno; (iv) preparing for the ExoMars Rover and landing platform; and (v) paving the way for future atmospheric science investigations on Venus (e.g., recently-selected EnVision for ESA’s M5 mission, as well as US Discovery-class missions) and the Ice Giants.  In particular, this meeting will be held just a few months after the results of the US decadal survey in planetary science (spring 2022), providing a chance to discuss new mission opportunities with international partners.  The last RMetS meeting on this topic were held at Burlington House in 2008 and 2015.
