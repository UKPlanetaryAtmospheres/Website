# UK Solar System Planetary Atmospheres

The study of Planetary Atmospheres is a key component of the UK’s planetary science portfolio, enabling leadership in instrumentation, multi-spectral data analysis (both space- and ground-based), and numerical simulation.  In recent decades, this has provided unique results from astronomical observatories and visiting spacecraft (e.g., Venus Express, Mars Express, ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, Galileo, Cassini, and Juno).

## Meeting Announcement - November 11th 2022

RAS Geophysics Specialist Discussion Meeting:  

*Exploring Planetary Atmospheric Processes from Terrestrial Worlds to Giant Planets*

Hybrid meeting, with in-person attendance at Burlington House (10:00-16:00), followed by a RAS Ordinary Meeting and the [James Dungey Lecture](https://ras.ac.uk/awards-and-grants/awards/2276-james-dungey-lecture) to be delivered by Dr. Licia Ray.

All attendees, both online and in person will have to register in advance via Eventbrite (link TBD).

**Organisers:**  Leigh N. Fletcher (University of Leicester, leigh.fletcher@le.ac.uk),  Karen Aplin (University of Bristol), Dann Mitchell (University of Bristol), Licia Ray (Lancaster University)   

**Call for Abstracts - Deadline September 29th:**. We invite abstracts from the Solar System Planetary Atmospheres community, highlighting new research and discoveries, new missions and opportunities, and sharing of techniques and tools to foster future collaborations within the community.  We will give priority to early-career speakers who have had limited opportunities to present their work during the pandemic.  To submit an abstract, please complete [this form](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=MH_ksn3NTkql2rGM8aQVGxN8Wl3UNtNPs5DGMjd0UFdUNzFFUzZVWEU2NDA4MDNEME5DVDcxRTRRRi4u) by September 29th), stating your preference for in-person or virtual participation.  The details of the hybrid approach (e.g., the platform for posters and interactions) will be provided in the coming weeks - please watch this space.

The community last met at a RAS-sponsored meeting in [February 2020](https://doi.org/10.1093/astrogeo/ataa040), providing an opportunity to celebrate achievements, to network and discuss future opportunities, and to give early-career researchers a chance to present their latest discoveries.  We hope to build on this foundation, and have secured the endorsements of both the Royal Meteorological Society (RMetS) and Europlanet Ireland-UK Hub to host this next community meeting.  

**Invited Speakers:** In the coming weeks, we will invite speakers with expertise in both terrestrial and planetary atmospheres, as well as experts on the interconnection between atmospheres and the magnetosphere/ionosphere.  Please watch this space for further details.

**Proposed Schedule:**
* 10:00-10:30 Arrival - Tea/Coffee at the RAS
* 10:30-13:00 Session I: Terrestrial Worlds
* 13:00-14:00 Lunch (Not Provided)
* 14:00-15:30 Session II: Atmosphere-Magnetosphere Connections
* 15:30-16:00 Tea @Geological Society

## UK Planetary Atmospheres Community

The UK community is spread across a number of universities (Bristol, Exeter, Leicester, Leeds, Newcastle, Open University, Oxford, UCL, Lancaster, Imperial), but unlike other UK communities (e.g., MIST, UK-Solar-Physics, Exoplanets) there are no regular community meetings.   A UK community meeting is timely given (i) upcoming atmospheric research opportunities from JWST in 2022/23; (ii) the forthcoming launch of ESA/JUICE in 2023; (iii) capitalising on data being provided by missions including ExoMars/TGO and Juno; (iv) preparing for the ExoMars Rover and landing platform; and (v) paving the way for future atmospheric science investigations on Venus (e.g., recently-selected EnVision for ESA’s M5 mission, as well as US Discovery-class missions) and the Ice Giants.  In particular, this meeting will be held just a few months after the results of the US decadal survey in planetary science (spring 2022), providing a chance to discuss new mission opportunities with international partners.
