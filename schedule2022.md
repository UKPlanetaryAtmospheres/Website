## Exploring Planetary Atmospheric Processes from Terrestrial Worlds to Giant Planets

For full abstracts for each presentation, please visit [Abstracts](abstracts.md).  Note that invited talks are allocated 30 minutes (25+5mins for Q&A), but contributed talks are offered 10 minutes (8+2 mins for Q&A).  The timings will be strictly adhered to, and match (approximately) the timings for international conferences like the EPSC and DPS.  Poster presenters will be invited to show a 60-second slide advertising their work during the morning session.
